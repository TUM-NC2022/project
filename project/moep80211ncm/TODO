session: rtt
We a need estimates for RTT to derive meaningfull timeout values for
retransmits and acknowledgements. However, what is 'RTT' in case of coded
packet networks? Probably we are not talking about echo request/replies here
but more likely about the minimum time to exchange feedback between session
endpoints.

generation/session/rlncblock: unidirectional sessions
Currently we assume bidirectional sessions only. Eventually we want to
implement alternative coding schemes based on unidirectional sessions sind
bidirectional ones induce inherent overhead when the underlying PHY is unable
to benefit.
