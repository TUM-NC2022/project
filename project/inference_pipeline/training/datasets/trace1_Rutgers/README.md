# Dataset - Rutgers University

**Traceset of RSSI measurement from the ORBIT testbed.**

This traceset includes received signal strength indication (RSSI) for each correctly received frame at receiving nodes when various levels of noise are injected into the ORBIT testbed.

## Dataset description

Full dataset description can be found [here](https://crawdad.cs.dartmouth.edu/rutgers/noise/20070420/).

### Directory structure

<dl>
  <dt><strong>data/</strong></dt>
  <dd>The actual data.</dd>

  <dt><strong>transform.py</strong></dt>
  <dd>
    Transforms traces from <i>data/</i> directory into flat structured, where missing sequence numbers are added, but no interpolation is performed. The output files reside in <i>${PROJECT_ROOT}/output/datasets/dataset-2-rutgers-wifi/</i> in a comma-separated values (CSV) format. All CSV files contain these seven columns with respective data types:
    <ul>
      <li>seq (sequence number) as <i>uint16</i> type</li>
      <li>src (source/transmitter node) as <i>string</i> type</li>
      <li>dst (destination/receiver node) as <i>string</i> type</li>
      <li>noise (artificial noise level) as <i>int8</i> type</li>
      <li>received (packet reception) as <i>boolean</i> type</li>
      <li>error (error indicator, RSSI == 128) as <i>boolean</i> type</li>
      <li>rssi (Reception Signal Strength Indicator) as <i>uint8</i> type</li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
  <dt><strong>interpolation.py</strong></dt>
  <dd>
    By default, `transform.py` preserve information regarding lost packets and missing RSSI values are filled with zeros. This script provides other interpolation methods on each trace CSV file in <i>${PROJECT_ROOT}/featureGenerator/datasets/dataset-2-rutgers-wifi/</i> on <strong>rssi</strong> column. Run script with `-h` or `--help` parameter for further instructions.
