Moep library
============

The Moep library (libmoep) features the moep802.11 and moep802.3 protocols as
well as the IEEE802.11 and IEEE802.3 protocols.

libmoep also allows for frame injection on 802.11 monitor mode devices with
per-frame radiotap options such as TX rate / MCS index and RTS/CTS protection.
Most of these options require small patches of the mac80211 susbsystem and
device specific drivers.


Dependencies
------------

libmoep depends on:

- libnl-3		http://www.infradead.org/~tgr/libnl/

If you use a git checkout you also need the following dependencies:

- automake		http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/
- autoconf		http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/
- autoconf-archive	http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf-archive/
- libtool		http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/
- doxygen		http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/


Installation
------------

To install libmoep you can use the following commands:

	./configure
	make
	make install

See ./configure --help for details on the available parameters. For example you
can use --prefix=DIR to specify the installation prefix or --enable-examples to
build the example programs.

If you use a git checkout you must run the following command first:

	autoreconf -fi


Linux drivers
-------------

A lot of functionality of libmoep requires some patches to the mac80211
subsystem. This version is known to work with kernel versions from 3.9 to 4.8.
Other versions might work as well but are not tested.

You can find appropriate patches for each kernel version in the patches
directory.


Documentation
-------------

See the bundled html documentation for a detailed description of the
functionality.

To link your programs against this library use pkg-config or -lmoep.
